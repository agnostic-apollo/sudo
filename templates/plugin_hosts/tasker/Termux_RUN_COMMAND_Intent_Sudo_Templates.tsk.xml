			<d>A task that provides templates for running `sudo` script commands with the `RUN_COMMAND` intent in `superuser (root)` context in termux. The commands are run using the Tasker `TermuxCommand()` function of the `Tasker Function` action and with the `am` command with the `Run Shell` action and are referred as intent actions in this task. This task requires Termux:Tasker version `&gt;= 0.5`. Tasker must be granted `com.termux.permission.RUN_COMMAND` permission. The `sudo` script must be installed at `$PREFIX/bin/sudo`. The `allow-external-apps` property must also be set to `true` in `~/.termux/termux.properties` file, otherwise any commands received via the `RUN_COMMAND` intent will not be executed by Termux. For android `&gt;= 10`, Termux must also be granted `Draw Over Apps` permissions so that foreground commands automatically start executing without the user having to manually click the `Termux` notification in the status bar dropdown notifications list for the commands to start. The device must be rooted and ideally `Termux` must have been granted root permissions by your root manager app like `SuperSU` or `Magisk` for the `sudo` script to work.

Check [Termux:Tasker Github](https://github.com/termux/termux-tasker) and [RunCommand Intent](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/wiki/RUN_COMMAND-Intent) for more details on `RUN_COMMAND` intent configuration.

Check [sudo](https://github.com/agnostic-apollo/sudo) for more details for the `sudo` script.


The result of commands is not received back when commands are run with the `RUN_COMMAND` intent, hence all templates run their commands in the foreground terminal session so that the results can be viewed. The `--sleep=3` command option is also passed to `sudo` so that it sleeps for `3` seconds before exiting. If this is not passed, the terminal would immediately close after `sudo` executes its commands without giving the user a chance to view the results in the terminal session. Moreover, a `Wait` action of `2` seconds is also added to the task after each template so that the templates execute in order and don't start until the previous one has at least ideally started executing.

The default value of the `%comma_alternative` variable in this task is set to `‚` (`#U+201A`, `&amp;sbquo;`, `&amp;#8218;`, `single low-9 quotation mark`). This is the same character that is replaced with the simple comma `,` (`U+002C`, `&amp;comma;`, `&amp;#44;`, `comma`) by the `sudo` script by default when the `-r` option is passed. You can use a different character that should be replaced using the `--comma-alternative` option.


Template 1 runs the `$PREFIX/bin/sudo --sleep=3 dumpsys -l` command in the foreground using `TermuxCommand()` function as a template for the `path` `command_type` to list all android services. The arguments do not contain any simple comma characters and hence can be passed directly without having to replace them with `%comma_alternative` characters.


Template 2 runs the `$PREFIX/bin/sudo -sr --sleep=3 '%core_script' '%argument_1' '%argument_2'` command in the foreground using `TermuxCommand()` function as a template for the `script` `command_type` with `bash` as the `sudo shell`, which would be chosen automatically by default without having to pass the `--shell` option. The `termux_tasker_basic_bash_test` `bash` script text is passed as the `core_script` argument with 2 complex dynamic args that may contain simple comma characters. The `-s` command option is passed to set `command_type` to `script`. The `-r` command option is passed so that `sudo` parses the arguments as per `RUN_COMMAND` intent rules. The `sudo` executable is passed to the intent using the `%executable` variable. The `%core_script`, `%argument_1` and `%argument_2` variables are used to store the dynamic values to be sent as `$1`, `$2` and `$3` respectively to `sudo`. They are first all set in the `%arguments` variable separated by simple comma characters, which is passed to the intent. The `%core_script`, `%argument_1` and `%argument_2` variables may contain any type of characters, even a simple comma, but simple commas must be replaced with the `%comma_alternative` characters before the intent action is run so that their values are not split into multiple arguments by the intent. To replace the simple commas, `Variable Search Replace` action is run to replace all simple commas `,` with the `%comma_alternative` variable value. The `Variable Search Replace` action must be used separately for each argument variable before adding it to the `%arguments` variable.  Do not set multiple arguments in the same variable and use `Variable Search Replace` action on it since that will result in incorrect argument splitting. This template shows how you can dynamically create intent commands at runtime using variables and send them via the `RUN_COMMAND` intent to Termux for execution, including passing the script text itself without having to create a physical file in `~/.termux/tasker/` directory.


Template 3 is almost the same as Template 2, but it runs the `$PREFIX/bin/sudo -sr --shell=python --sleep=3 '%core_script' '%argument_1' '%argument_2'` command in the foreground using `am` command as a template for the `script` `command_type` with `python` as the `sudo shell`. The `termux_tasker_basic_python_test` `python` script text is passed as the `core_script` argument with 2 complex dynamic args that may contain simple comma characters. However, as already mentioned that this template uses the `am` command, the `%arguments` variable is passed to the `com.termux.RUN_COMMAND_ARGUMENTS` string array extra surrounded with single quotes inside a shell and hence any single quotes inside the `%arguments` variable also need to be escaped before running the intent command to prevent incorrect quoting. To escape the single quotes, `Variable Search Replace` action is run to replace all single quotes `'` with one single quote, followed by one backslash, followed by two single quotes `'\''`. So `%arguments` surrounded with single quotes that would have been passed like `'some arg with single quote ' in it'` will be passed as `'some arg with single quote '\'' in it'`. This is basically 3 parts `'some arg with single quote '`, `\'` and `' in it'` but when processed, it will be considered as one single argument with the value `some arg with single quote ' in it` that is passed as the `com.termux.RUN_COMMAND_ARGUMENTS` string array extra value. The `Variable Search Replace` action does not need to be used separately for each argument variable before adding it to the `%arguments` variable, running it on only the final `%arguments` variable would be fine, unlike how its done on individual argument variables like `%argument_1`, etc for usage with `Termux:Tasker` plugin.


Template 4 runs `$PREFIX/bin/sudo --shell-pre-commands="echo 'starting sudo shell';" --title='sudo' su` in the foreground using `TermuxCommand()` function as a template for the `su` `command_type` to start an interactive `bash` shell with priority to termux binaries and libraries. The `--shell-pre-commands` option is passed to run some commands before starting the interactive `bash` shell and its argument is **not** passed surrounded with single or double quotes to prevent whitespace splitting in the intent action, like done for usage with `Termux:Tasker` plugin since splitting will occur on simple comma characters instead. If there are going to be simple comma characters in arguments to the command options or in the main arguments to `sudo`, you must replace them with `%comma_alternative` variable value and pass the `-r` option. The `--title` option is passed to set the title of the terminal.


The `$PREFIX/` is a shortcut for the termux prefix directory `/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/`. The `~/` is a shortcut for the termux home directory `/data/data/com.termux/files/home/`. These shortcuts can be used in any path arguments to the `sudo` command.


The `%command_failed` variable will be set if the intent action failed, this is detected by whether `%err` or `%errmsg` is set by the intent action. If you run multiple intent actions in the same task or are using `Local Variable Passthrough`, then you must clear the `%command_failed` variable and optionally the `%errmsg` variable with the `Variable Clear` action before running each intent action, in case they were already set, like by a previously failed intent action after which the task was not stopped.
